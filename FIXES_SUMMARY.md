- Files now remain uploaded even when switching tabs

### 2. **Sales Prediction Section Not Opening** ❌➜✅

**Problem**: Predict Demand section had rendering issues
**Solution**:

- Fixed Dashboard component syntax errors
- Added proper error boundaries
- Added debug logging for troubleshooting
- Fixed section rendering logic

### 3. **Step Progress Synchronization** ❌➜✅

**Problem**: Step completion not properly tracked across sections
**Solution**:

- Added auto-completion detection
- Fixed step mapping between navigation and progress
- Added persistent completion state

## 🚀 **System Status**

✅ **Backend Integration**: All Python scripts connected  
✅ **File Upload**: CSV files detected and ready  
✅ **API Endpoints**: All endpoints operational  
✅ **Frontend**: Beautiful UI with persistent state  
✅ **Navigation**: Smooth switching between sections

## 📊 **Current File Status**

Your uploaded files are ready:

- `sales_train_validation.csv` - 120MB ✅
- `calendar.csv` - 103KB ✅
- `sell_prices.csv` - 137MB ✅

## 🧪 **Testing Instructions**

### Test 1: File Persistence

1. Go to "Upload Data" section
2. Files should show as already uploaded
3. Switch to "Train Model" tab
4. Return to "Upload Data"
5. ✅ Files should still be there

### Test 2: Complete Workflow

1. **Upload Data** → Click "Preprocess Data"
2. **Train Model** → Click "Train Forecasting Model"
3. **Predict Demand** → Select parameters and predict
4. **Plan Routes** → Set threshold and generate route
5. **Download** → Export results

### Test 3: Navigation During Processing

1. Start data preprocessing
2. Switch to different sections
3. ✅ Processing should continue in background
4. ✅ State should be preserved

## 🎯 **Key Improvements**

### State Management

- Persistent file uploads across navigation
- Global step completion tracking
- Background processing preservation

### Error Handling

- Added error boundaries
- Debug logging for troubleshooting
- Graceful failure recovery

### User Experience

- Smooth navigation
- Real-time system status
- Visual progress indicators
- Auto-completion detection
